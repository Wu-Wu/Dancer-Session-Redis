DESCRIPTION
    This module is a Redis backend for the session engine of Dancer
    application. This module is a descendant of Dancer::Session::Abstract.

CONFIGURATION
    In order to use this session engine, you have to set up a few settings
    (in the app or app's configuration file).

    *   session

        Set the vaue Redis. Required parameter.

    *   redis_session

        Settings for backend.

        *server*
            Hostname and port of the redis-server instance which will be
            used to store session data. This one is required unless *sock*
            is defined.

        *sock*
            unix socket path of the redis-server instance which will be used
            to store session data.

        *password*
            Password string for redis-server's AUTH command to processing
            any other commands. Optional. Check the redis-server manual for
            directive *requirepass* if you would to use redis internal
            authentication.

        *database*
            Database # to store session data. Optional. Default value is 0.

        *expire*
            Session TTL. Optional. Default value is 900 (seconds).

        *ping*
            Time (in seconds) to check connection alive and re-establish in
            case of closed connection. Optional. Default value is 5
            (seconds). Redis server close connection after a client is idle
            for seconds but server instance might be configured to not close
            client's connection. Check the redis server manual.

        *debug*
            Enables debug information to STDERR, including all interactions
            with the redis-server. Optional. Default value is 0.

METHODS
  init()
    Validate settings and creates the initial connection to redis-server.

  create()
    Creates a new object, runs "flush" and returns the object.

  flush()
    Writes the session information to the Redis database.

  retrieve()
    Retrieves session information from the Redis database.

  destroy()
    Deletes session information from the Redis database.
